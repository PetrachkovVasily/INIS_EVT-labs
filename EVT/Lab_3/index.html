                <strong>Gameplay description</strong>
                <p><em>The Messenger</em> is a side-scrolling action-platformer inspired by the Ninja Gaiden series. Players control a ninja known as <em>The Messenger</em> as he goes on a quest to deliver a scroll on behalf of a great hero. <em>The Messenger</em> can run, jump, attack with his sword, and perform a technique called "Cloudstepping", which allows him to perform an extra jump in mid-air after attacking an enemy or object.</p>
                <p>As the game progresses, <em>the Messenger</em> gains new abilities such as climbing walls, and a "rope dart" used to propel himself through obstacles and enemies. By collecting Time Shards earned by defeating enemies or exploring, the player can purchase additional upgrades such as being able to destroy projectiles. If the player dies, a demon named Quarble will appear and revive them at the last checkpoint that they reached. Afterwards, Quarble will follow the player around for a short amount of time.
